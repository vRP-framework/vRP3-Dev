= Transformer

This module adds transformers.

* it's a generic system to transform (generate, process, convert) items/money/etc to items/money/etc in a specific area
* each transformer can take things to generate other things, using a unit of work
* units are regenerated periodically at a specific rate
* reagents => products (ex: reagents can be nothing to create an harvest transformer)

self.transformers -- map of id => transformer
self.processors -- registered processors, map of id => {on_display, on_check, on_process}

-- register a transformer processor
-- on_display(user, reagents, products): should return r_info, p_info (two html strings to display info about the reagents and products)
-- on_check(user, reagents, products): should return true if the processing can occur
-- on_process(user, reagents, products): should process the transformation
-- for the three callbacks:
--- reagents: reagents data, can be nil
--- products: products data, can be nil
Transformer:registerProcessor(id, on_display, on_check, on_process)
