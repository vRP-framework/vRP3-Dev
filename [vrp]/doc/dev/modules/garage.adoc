= Garage

This module manages garages and character vehicles.

Each owned vehicle has a saved state which can be extended with new properties.

[NOTE]
====
.Vehicles in FiveM/GTA V are entities which can unload/load/despawn themselves on multiple clients, this module try to handle it this way.
* it tracks the owned vehicles with a decorator and will try to re-own the vehicles when near them
* if multiple versions of the same owned vehicle exist at the same place, it will try to delete the others
* vehicles states are saved and it will try to re-spawn the vehicles if near their last saved position
* if a vehicle is stuck or completely lost somewhere, players can force its re-spawn at the garage by paying a fee
