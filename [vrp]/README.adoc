=== Issues / Features / Help

WARNING: Read the documentation before asking for help, creating a bug report or a feature request.

When submitting an issue, add any information you can find, with all details. Saying that something doesn't work will probably not be enough to solve the issue.
If you have errors in your console _before_ the issue happens, things could be corrupted, so the issue may be irrelevant. You should solve all unrelated errors before submitting issues.

When submitting a feature request, make sure the feature is relevant about the core of the framework or already existing vRP features. vRP is a framework, thus it doesn't aim to implement everything, but to give the tools to do so.

WARNING: The issue section is only for bug reports and feature requests. Issues not related to the core of vRP, about old versions (no backwards update) or vRP modifications will be closed without warning.

TIP: Before submitting an issue or a feature request, do a search in open and closed ones to know if it has been reported/requested before.

NOTE: For questions, help, discussions around the project, please go instead on the vRP thread of the FiveM forum or the discord.
